"""
Create a terminal program that displays a list of rooms available for rent and the price of each room to the user. This information is available in a comma-separated text file.
`rooms.txt`
# code, name, price
1,Master Suite,500
2,Family Room,200
3,Single Room,100
4,Standard Room,100

`rooms.txt`
# code, name, price
1,Master Suite,500
2,Family Room,200
3,Single Room,100
4,Standard Room,50

The program asks the user for their name, the room number to be reserved,
and the number of days, and finally displays the estimated amount to be paid.

The program must save this choice in another file containing the reservations

`reservations.txt`
# customer, room, days
Bruno,3,12

If another user tries to reserve the same room, the program must display a
message informing them that it is already reserved.
